In contrast to the example page, the data is converted and poured into a companion bloc where it is possible to implement state changes to the received data. This makes it possible to continue to use a bloc that inherits from the basic ws bloc, but as it cannot be extended (blocs developed using the freezed package do not allow them to be extended), another one is added for manipulating data",

It is possible to convert them to the local timezone of the device in use, but it is not possible to set (and possibly convert them back to an isostring) with a specific timezone offset. In the following, 3 dates relating to the same moment in time are printed out (but in 3 different timezones, e.g. relating to 3 different places with different time zones) retrieved from the same service. The three dates will first be interpreted and printed with the native DateTime type, after which they will be printed with a custom type (realised ontop of the native DateTime) that preserves their timezone.",
